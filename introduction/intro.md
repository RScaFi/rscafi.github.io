# Introduction

This website contains all the documentation produced for the `Rust Fields` project, which is brought on with a Domain Driven approach.

## Description

This project was born from the willing to extend ScaFi: a Scala-based library and framework for Aggregate Programming.

Currently, ScaFi is JVM dependant. This could create some problems on 'thin' devices, which don't have enough resources to run a JVM.

The goal of this project is to explore different solutions to make the field calculus available on thin devices.
