# Design Overview

The RustFields application is designed with a modular and organized architecture. In the [Architectural Design](architectural-design.md) section, 
we outline the core components of ScaFi-core and RuFi-core, along with their execution process using the VM interface. 
The [Detailed Design](detailed-design.md) section highlights critical design choices and key functions. Additionally, we introduce Scafi-fields, 
enabling explicit manipulation of fields.

Overall, RustFields prioritizes modularity, code clarity, and scalability while adhering to Rust's specifications. 
The application's design facilitates extensibility for future projects.
