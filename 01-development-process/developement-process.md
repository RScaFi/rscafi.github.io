title: Development Process

The development process employed is an Agile methodology, incorporating integrations in the early stages based on a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach.

Initially, a series of knowledge-crunching sessions were conducted, following the principles of DDD. These meetings involved all team members and a domain expert.

After thoroughly exploring the domain during the initial phase, the architecture was devised to facilitate modularization, simplifying work division and minimizing integration challenges.

Subsequently, the system implementation was divided into weekly sprints. After each sprint, a meeting took place with domain experts to validate the completed work and ensure alignment between expectations and achieved outcomes.
